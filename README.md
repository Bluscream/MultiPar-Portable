# MultiPar

v1.3.1.8 is public

 This is minor bug fix version. 
Though I updated many files, most users don't see the difference. 
Because there may be a problem still, I didn't set this version as stable yet. 
When I cannot re-produce a problem nor test a behavior myself, it's difficult to solve. 
If there is no serious problem, next version will be the last of v1.3.1 tree. 
When you see a bug, odd incident, or strange behavior, please let me know. 
I will fix as possible as I can.

 I changed the order of files in Windows 10 style. 
It treats digits as numbers in filenames. 
Though the method was introduced from Windows 7, I didn't change for compatibility. 

 Windows 10 supports multiple monitors with different DPI. 
The method is called as PerMonitorV2 in application manifest. 
I implemented the way, and MultiPar would be less blurry on a secondary monitor now. 
Because I cannot test the behavior myself, I'm not sure it works on each user's case. 
If someone sees a problem on his PC, please report the incident with a screen-shot. 
Thanks John L. Galt for many tests on multiple monitors.
