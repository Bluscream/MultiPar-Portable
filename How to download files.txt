 By clicking "Releases" item on the right panel, you will see every version.
You may download your favorite MultiPar package at "Assets" item.

 Beta version may have some bug or problem.
If you use stable MultiPar already, no need to update immediately.
Only when you have a complaint in old version, try new version.

 Alpha version isn't tested so much.
I may update those pre-release versions at times.
Only when you test a new feature or behavior, try alpha version.
