[ Note ]

 This client supports "Comments" on index file (*.PAR).
 This supports Multi-Byte Character like Japanese.
 This supports empty file (size = 0).

 You may set many source files by file-list instead of command line.
 Source files may locate different directory with Recovery files.

 PAR 1.0 does not support sub-directry or folder.
 You cannot specify Non-Recovery-Set files. (Empty files are set.)
 Number of recovery files are limited to 99.

 This requires a PC of Windows Vista or later (Windows 7, 8, 10, 11).
 This is developed with Visual Studio 2022 on Windows 10.
