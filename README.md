# MultiPar

### v1.3.2.5 is public

&nbsp; This is a minor update version. 
When you don't see any problem in your using version, you don't need to replace. 
I updated development environment from Visual Studio 2019 to Visual Studio 2022. 
The supported OS is same as previous version (Windows Vista or later). 
If you see a compatibility issue, please report with ease.

&nbsp; I test two new features on MultiPar GUI. 
They are [Fixed redundancy size](https://github.com/Yutaka-Sawada/MultiPar/issues/69) 
and [Add file status sorting function](https://github.com/Yutaka-Sawada/MultiPar/issues/71) 
on GitHub issues. 
I changed the behavior of "RedundancyMax" and "Sort" option on "MultiPar.ini". 
If many users like it, I may change the default behavior in future.

&nbsp; This year, I started to learn Python. 
It's useful than Batch script. 
It's possible to show GUI. 
I will use it to make simple tools. 
Python is much easier than C language, however it seems to be slow. 
I put some Python script files in `tool` folder of MultiPar. 
Users may edit them for thier usage. 
I added help documents for Python script, too.
