[ MultiPar GUI - version 1.3.3.3 or later ]

Usage: MultiPar.exe [command] [/base path] [/list path] [files]

Command:
/create : open Create window with specified source files
/verify : open Verify window with a specified recovery file
/clean  : remove integration and delete saved files

When there is no command;
If multiple files are specified, it will open Create window.
If a single recovery file is specified, it will open Verify window.
If a single another file is specified, it will open Create window.


[ Format of path ]

 Path of [files] can be either absolute path (full path)
or relative path from base directory.
When /base isn't set,
the sub-directory of the first path becomes the base directory.
When /base is set, 
relative path of following files is based on there.

 If you failed to write a path or format correctly,
the input and following option may be ignored.
When a path contains space (' '),
the path must be covered by "" like "C:\Program Files\abc\abc.txt".
Be careful to use '\' in a path, because it may be escape character.
It is safe to use '/' instead of '\' to be called by script language.
Each '/' in a path will be converted to '\' internally.


[ About "/base" option ]

 If you want to specify base directory,
use /base and path of the directory like;
/create /base "dir-path"
/create /base "dir-path" "source file 1" "source file 2"
/create /base "dir-path" /list "file-list"
/verify /base "dir-path" "recovery file"
The [/base path] can be either absolute path (full path)
or relative path from current directory.


[ About "/list" option ]

 If you want to specify many source files for creation,
use /list and path of the file-list like;
/create /list "file-list"
/create /base "dir-path" /list "file-list"
The file-list is a text file, which contain file path in each line.
Non-ASCII characters must be encoded by UTF-8.
After reading the list, MultiPar will delete it automatically.


[ When you set a folder instead of files ]

 If only a single folder is specified for creation,
all files in the folder will be selected.
When base directory is set by /base and files are not set,
all files in the base directory will be selected.


[ About "/clean" option ]

 Mostly /clean is used before un-install.
Association and Shell Extention will be removed.
Short-cut incons will be deleted.
MultiPar.log and temporary files will be deleted.
When "Display Delete Confirmation Dialog box" in the Recycle Bin is checked,
confimation to delete MultiPar.ini is shown.
Because the MultiPar.ini file will go to the Recycle Bin,
it is possible to keep current setting for update install.


[ About INI File ]

 There are some special settings in "MultiPar.ini",
which may not be set at Option window.

 If you want to set your favorite font like "Arial",
write this line "FontName=Arial" under "[Option]" section.
The font is shown as an item at "GUI options" section on "GUI options" tab
on MultiPar's Option window.

 You may add a new line for "Range of redundancy" on
"MultiPar Options" -> "Client behavior" tab -> "Creation options" section.
To do so, manually add or edit an item of "RedundancyMax".
If you want to set the max 10%, the line is "RedundancyMax=10".
The range of value is from 5 to 200.

 If you want to sort source files on Verify window by Status,
write this line "Sort=8" under "[Option]" section.
To return normal behavior (disable sorting), just erase the line.

 If you want to limit size of Recovery Files,
write a line of "RecoveryFileLimit=1" under "[Option]" section.
It's same as an option:
"Variable (limited to size of largest data file)" on QuickPar.

 If you want to limit size of Recovery Files by a specific value,
write a line of "RecoveryFileLimit=2" under "[Option]" section.
"Limit Size to" value is enabled, even when "Split Files" isn't checked.
This setting is useful, if you don't want to split source files.

 If you want to enable "Most Resent Used List",
write this line "MRUMax=5" under "[Path]" section.
You may change the number of items after "MRUMax=".
Because of alphabet, "MRUMax=26" is the maximum.
If you write "MRUMax=0" or remove the line,
"Most Resent Used List" is disabled.

 If you want to add 5th item in "Media size" list on Create window,
write this line "MediaList4=name:size" under "[Option]" section.
Because the name and size are splitted by ":",
you cannot include ":" in the name.
The max size is 999999999999 bytes. (931 GB)
