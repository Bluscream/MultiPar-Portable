# MultiPar

### v1.3.2.7 is public

&nbsp; This is a minor update version for Python script users. 
There is no difference in basic feature. 
If you don't use Python script, no need to update. 
When there is no problem in this version, 
next version will be the last of v1.3.2 tree.

&nbsp; There are some Python script files in `tool` folder of MultiPar. 
Users may edit them for thier usage. 
As I'm learning Python language still, I may modify these samples later. 
When a user request a new feature in MutliPar, 
I may implement it as an independent tool. 
Users would edit them for thier usage.
