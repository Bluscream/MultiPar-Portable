<font size=5>GUI options</font>
<hr>

<h3>GUI options</h3>

<dl><dt><b>
Language
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
You can change language of user interface. 
"<b>Auto</b>" is default setting of PC. 
Only when you want to use different language, select another. 
This change will become enabled, when you start MultiPar next time. 
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Font
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
You can change looks and size of characters. 
Normally "<b>MS Shell Dlg 2</b>" is the standard font for dialog. 
When you set another font at OS's graphic setting, the font may be shown in this list. 
If you want to set your favorite font like "Arial", 
write this line "<tt>FontName=Arial</tt>" under "<tt>[Option]</tt>" section on "<tt>MultiPar.ini</tt>" file directly.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Format of file size
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
You may select your favorite format. 
When you don't care small difference, "<b>With unit</b>" looks simple. 
If you use Windows Explorer, "<b>With kilo-bytes</b>" looks samely. 
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Style of text on progress-bar
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
You may change background of text over progress-bar.
</dd></dl>

<hr>

<h3>Supported media and sizes</h3>
<p>&nbsp
These contents are used for a list of "<b>Media</b>" on Create window. 
In the edit box, you must put "<b>:</b>" between the media's name and size. 
The name is left side, "<b>:</b>" is middle, and the size is right side. 
The size must be value only, don't use comma or unit simbol like MB. 
The max length of name is 18, and max size is 999999999999 (931 GB).
</p>

<a name="unit_size"></a>
<h3>Restrict block size to multiples of the unit</h3>
<p>&nbsp
When you create PAR2 files, you may change the block allocation. 
By setting an unit size of blocks, 
the block size will become a multiple of the unit.
</p>

<dl><dt><b>
No restriction on the size
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
When you don't set unit, you will be able to change the block size freely.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Exact
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
You can set the unit as bytes directly. 
By setting <b>Cluster size</b> of your saving drive, 
you can verify and repair efficienctly. 
For example, you would better set 2 KB for CD-R or DVD-R. 
It may be from 4 KB to 64 KB for HDD, 
or from 512-bytes to 4KB for USB memory.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
For yEnc</b> or <b>For UUEncode
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
Only when you post the files on <b>UseNet</b>, you should set the unit as lines of the encoding. 
Because the setting depends on your UseNet server, 
you must follow the directions of the server.
</dd></dl>

<a name="block_allocation"></a>
<h3>Block allocating method</h3>
<p>&nbsp
When you select source files to create PAR2 files, 
source blocks are allocated for the files. 
By this option, you can change the method of how to allocate blocks. 
Everytime you add or remove files, blocks will be allocated by the selected method automatically.
</p>

<dl><dt><b>
Limit Block count up to
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
As there are many blocks, creation will require more time. 
If you want to limit the number of blocks, set the max block count and check this. 
Be careful not to set too few blocks, 
because large block size will be inefficient to recover small damages. 
In the era of CD or DVD, par2cmdline sets 2,000 blocks and QuickPar sets 3,000 blocks.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Rate (count / size)
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
This rate is block count divided by block size. 
For example, setting "1%" for 10,000-bytes block size gives 100 blocks, 
as "<tt>100 blocks / 10000-bytes = 0.01 = 1%</tt>". 
This calculation method is ideal for widely varied data size. 
As total data size becomes large, more blocks will be allocated, but the change is mild.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Block size
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
You may set preferred block size. 
When you set unit size, resulting block size will be adjusted. 
If you treat similar data size usually, this calculation method may be good. 
Be careful about the result of too few or too many blocks.
</dd></dl>

<p>&nbsp
Because MultiPar tries to find efficient allocation by adjusting block size, 
the result may be different from your specified value. 
If you want to get a specific block size always, 
set "Block size" here, and select "No restriction on the size" on <a href="option2.htm#unit_size">above section</a>. 
If you want to allocate blocks like QuickPar, 
you need to check "Limit Block count up to" and set "Block size".
