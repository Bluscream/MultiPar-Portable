<h3>Install or uninstall with installer package</h3>
<p>&nbsp
Double click setup file ( <tt>MultiPar131_setup.exe</tt> or something like this name ),
and follow the installer dialog. 
At version up, if you want to use previous setting, overwrite install is possible. 
Before overwrite install, you should un-check "Integrate MultiPar into Shell". 
You may need to re-start OS after overwrite install or uninstall rarely. 
To install under "<tt>Program Files</tt>" or "<tt>Program Files (x86)</tt>" directory, 
you must start the installer with administrative privileges by selecting 
"Run as administrator" on right-click menu.
</p>
<p>&nbsp
You can uninstall through the Windows OS's Control Panel, 
or double click <tt>unins000.exe</tt> in a folder which MultiPar was installed. 
Because uninstaller does not delete setting files or newly put files, 
you may delete them by yourself.
</p>
<p>&nbsp
When you have used installer package, you should not move install folder. 
Or else, you will fail to uninstall later.
</p>

<h3>Installation for multiple users by installer package</h3>
<p>&nbsp
If multiple users may log-on a PC, the administrator can install MultiPar for everyone. 
By installing with administrative privileges, installer made Start Menu icon, 
Desktop icon, and File association will be available for all users. 
When he installed under "<tt>Program Files</tt>" directory, each user keeps individual setting. 
When he installed in another folder, all users share same setting. 
In either case, user made icons and association are available for the user only.
</p>

<h3>Install with archive version</h3>
<p>&nbsp
Unpack compressed file ( <tt>MultiPar131.zip</tt> or something like this name ) in a folder.
<tt>MultiPar.exe</tt> is the interface of MultiPar.
</p>
<p>&nbsp
You can create short-cut icon or send-to link at Option window later. 
If you associate PAR file extensions "<tt>.par</tt>" or "<tt>.par2</tt>" with MultiPar, 
de-associate them from other application like QuickPar at first. 
</p>

<h3>Un-install with archive version</h3>
<p>&nbsp
If you associate PAR file with MultiPar, de-associate them from this. 
Delete all files in the install folder, in which you extract files. 
If you installed MultiPar under "<tt>Program Files</tt>" directory, 
setting data was saved in MultiPar folder under "<tt>Application Data</tt>" directory, 
so you need to delete the folder.
</p>
<p>&nbsp
When you integrated MultiPar into shell at Option window, 
you must clear the check before un-install. 
If you have deleted <tt>MultiPar.exe</tt> already, you can un-install the DLL manually. 
Open "Command Prompt" and change directory to MultiPar's folder, 
then type "<tt>RegSvr32.exe /u MultiParShlExt64.dll</tt>" to remove shell extension. 
You cannot delete "<tt>MultiParShlExt64.dll</tt>", while it is used by OS or Explorer. 
You may log-off and log-on again to OS before deleting the file.
</p>

<h3>Change installed folder of archive version</h3>
<p>&nbsp
Move files in the install folder. 
If you associated PAR file with MultiPar, de-associate once, and associate again. 
If you want to use same setting at another PC, copy the setting file "<tt>MultiPar.ini</tt>".
If you move MultiPar into "Program Files" directory, 
setting data is saved in MultiPar folder under "Application Data" directory, 
so you need to move "<tt>MultiPar.ini</tt>" into the folder, too.
