<font size=5>Sample of Python script</font>
<hr>

<p>&nbsp
To use Python script, you need to install <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> in your PC. 
The official <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">download site is here</a>. 
There are some useful documents and articles on the Internet. 
You may edit a sample script for your usage.
</p>

<p>&nbsp
Python script is saved on some text files in <tt>tool</tt> folder under MultiPar's installed directory. 
If you put a script file on another folder or under <tt>Program Files</tt> directory, you must set the path of <tt>par2j64.exe</tt> or <tt>MultiPar.exe</tt> on your PC. 
By default, I write relative path from the <tt>tool</tt> folder. 
You can refer the directory on MultiPar's Option window: 
"System settings" tab, "Folder location" section, "Open MultiPar's install folder" button.
</p>

<h3>Create individual PAR2 set in each selected folder</h3>
<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 width="100%">
<tr><td>Command<td>"path of script file" "path of folder1" "path of folder2" "path of folder3"... 
<tr><td>Input<td>specify some folders
<tr><td>Action<td>This sample creates individual PAR2 set in each selected folder. 
For example, when you supply 7 folders, total 7 PAR2 set are made.
<tr><td>Script file<td><tt><a href="../../tool/each_folder.py">each_folder.py</a></tt>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp
This is a simple script, which task is enough for batch script.
</p>

<h3>Create individual PAR2 set in each selected folder with GUI</h3>
<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 width="100%">
<tr><td>Command<td>"path of script file" "path of folder1" "path of folder2" "path of folder3"... 
<tr><td>Input<td>specify some folders
<tr><td>Action<td>This sample creates individual PAR2 set in each selected folder. 
For example, when you supply 7 folders, total 7 PAR2 set are made. 
It shows GUI for setting. 
It's possible to filter source files by their size.
<tr><td>Script file<td><tt><a href="../../tool/large_files.py">large_files.py</a></tt>
<tr><td>Caution<td>You must check MultiPar Option: "Always use folder name for base filename" in "Creation options" section on "Client behavior" tab.
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp
Instead of searching all files in each specified folder, 
it will filter files by their size. 
In the sample, it selects files of 1 MB over. 
You may change the limit size. 
To send name of source files, it uses file-list.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Create multiple PAR2 sets for many files in a folder</h3>
<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 width="100%">
<tr><td>Command<td>"path of script file" "path of folder1" "path of folder2" "path of folder3"... 
<tr><td>Input<td>specify some folders
<tr><td>Action<td>This sample creates multiple PAR2 sets for many files in each selected folder. 
For example, when you supply 3 folders, it creates independent multiple PAR2 sets in every folder. 
In the sample, it will create a PAR2 set for 1000 source files. 
It's possible to change the limit value. 
When there are 3500 files in a folder, it will create 4 PAR2 sets in the folder.
<tr><td>Script file<td><tt><a href="../../tool/group_files.py">group_files.py</a></tt>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp
To distinguish PAR2 files, it uses stable filename with serial numbering. 
They are like; <tt>#1.par2</tt>, <tt>#2.par2</tt>, <tt>#3.par2</tt>... 
When there are sub directories in a folder, it will search inner files. 
To send name of source files, it uses file-list. 
The process may be very slow for many files.
</p>

<h3>Verify many PAR2 sets in a selected folder with GUI</h3>
<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 width="100%">
<tr><td>Command<td>"path of script file" "path of folder"
<tr><td>Input<td>specify a folder
<tr><td>Action<td>This sample verifies many PAR2 sets in a selected folder. 
For example, when there are 7 PAR2 sets in a folder, they are shown on a list. 
It will verify each PAR2 set continuously. 
It's possible to stop queue on GUI.
<tr><td>Script file<td><tt><a href="../../tool/queue_verify.py">queue_verify.py</a></tt>
<tr><td>Caution<td>You must select MultiPar Option: "Re-use verification result" to be "For 3 days" or longer, 
and you should check "Don't search subfolders" in "Verification and Repair options" section on "Client behavior" tab.
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp
In this sample, it tries verification only. 
If you want to repair a damaged set automatically, use "r" command instead of "v". 
When you want to confirm result by MultiPar, select a PAR set and push "Open with MultiPar" button. 
You may repair on the MultiPar GUI.
</p>
<p>&nbsp
While verification, it shows details on Command Prompt window. 
You can control the verification by pushing a key on the Command Prompt. 
You may pause the process by pushing P-key. 
You may resume the process by pushing R-key. 
You may cancel the process by pushing C-key. 
Even when you stop the verification task, it may save result partially.
</p>

<h3>Rename included source files in PAR2 sets with GUI</h3>
<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 width="100%">
<tr><td>Command<td>"path of script file" "path of file"
<tr><td>Input<td>specify a PAR2 file
<tr><td>Action<td>This is a simple tool to edit names of source files in PAR2 files. 
Because it works in a single file, you don't need to set path of another application.
<tr><td>Script file<td><tt><a href="../../tool/par2_rename.py">par2_rename.py</a></tt>
<tr><td>Caution<td>The modified PAR2 files by this tool are different from formal PAR2 files for renamed filenames.
When someone generates new PAR2 files for renamed filenames by QuickPar/MultiPar,
the PAR2 files are incompatible with these modified PAR2 files.
</table>
</p>

<p>&nbsp
How to use<br>
<ol>
<li>Select a PAR2 file by pushing [ File ] button. PAR2 files of same base name will be listed.</li>
<li>Select a PAR2 file on the left list and push [ Read ] button. 
It's good to select the smallest PAR2 file for fast search. 
Only when PAR2 files are damaged, select a complete PAR2 file.</li>
<li>Type a new filename on a edit box. 
Select editing name on right list and push [ Rename ] button. 
You may edit multiple filenames contiuously.</li>
<li>After you finish to edit filenames, push [ Save ] button. 
PAR2 files will be saved with prefix "new_" in the same folder.</li>
</ol>
