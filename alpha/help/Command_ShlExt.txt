* How to change items on context menu by adding option in "MultiPar.ini".

 You can put a key for Shell Extension DLL,
which key name is "ShellExtension" under [Option] section.
You need to restart Windows Explorer for refresh, after you changed the value.
The default value is 0, when the key doesn't exist.

 The value consists in multiple bit.
Currently each bit means following;
 1: put separator above the menu
 2: put separator below the menu
 4: put separator between sub-menus
 8: remove additional sub-menus (show single sub-menu)
16: remove icon of the menu
32: disable sub-menu for archiver
64: disable sub-menus (show top menu only)

 You add each setting value, and write the total value.
When you set both 1 and 2, the menu title is put independently.

 When you select a single file, sub-menus for "Create" and "Verify" are shown.
You may remove the "Verify" sub-menu, if you want simple action like QuickPar.

 When 7-Zip is installed, sub-menu for "Archive" is shown.
Selected files are archived by 7-Zip, and MultiPar protects the archive file.

 If you want QuickPar style independent menu with single sub-menu,
set 1, 2, and 8, then the resulting value becomes 11.
The example key is like below;

[Option]
ShellExtension=11


* Format of language specific text in "MultiParShlExt.ini"

 Set Language ID (0x????) to section name.
When there is no section for the specified language in MultiPar.ini,
section of near language or English (0x0409) is used.
If you want to disable a section temporary,
append something to the section name like "[0x0409ignore]".

 "MenuTitle" and "Create" are essential to show menu and sub-menu.
If you erase these strings or lines, default strings are used.

 "CreateHelp" and "VerifyHelp" in old version were removed,
because they are ignored on recent Windows OS like (Vista, 7, 8).

 Strings may contain one "&" for keyboard short-cut.
Each strings should be reasonably short (under 40 characters).
Total length of four strings is max 252 characters.

 "Comment" is not used by DLL, but is a notice for editors.

 New setting will be enabled after next loading of Windows Explorer.

 The default text is like below;

[0x0409]
MenuTitle=&MultiPar
Create=Create Recovery Files
Verify=Verify Recovery File
Archive=Archive and Create Recovery Files

 If you want QuickPar style text, modify like below;

[0x0409]
MenuTitle=&Multi Par
Create=Create Recovery Volumes
Verify=
Archive=
