# MultiPar

### v1.3.2.4 is public

&nbsp; This is a minor update version. 
When you don't see any problem in your using version, you don't need to replace. 
To decrease false positive at malware detection by some security vendors, 
I added VERSIONINFO in each application's resource. 
Now you see version information for console application. 
It may be useful to check version number on Windows Explorer.

&nbsp; While MultiPar supports SFV and MD5 files as same as QuickPar, I didn't test so much. 
I improved the compatibility to recognize # as starting comment. 
Thanks [fooziex](https://github.com/Yutaka-Sawada/MultiPar/issues/62) for reporting the problem and samples. 
Because there are variety of SFV or MD5 file format, I may not know a minor style. 
If you see a problem, please tell me with ease.
