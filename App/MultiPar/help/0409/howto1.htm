<font size=5>Basic use of MultiPar</font>
<hr>

<h3>Compatibility with QuickPar</h3>
<p>&nbsp
How to use is almost same as <a href="http://www.quickpar.org.uk/" target="_blank" title="http://www.quickpar.org.uk/">QuickPar</a>. 
But there are some different behavior, 
because the development environment and how to implement are different. 
Moreover I added some useful features which QuickPar lacks; 
such like supporting directory tree or preview before creation. 
If you have a new idea, you may request by mail.
</p>
<p>&nbsp
While QuickPar's default settings are optimized for UseNet, they are different from those of MultiPar. 
If you want to set similar setting as QuickPar, you need to change the following items from default setting;<br>
On [GUI options] page, in [<a href="option2.htm#unit_size">Restrict block size to multiples of the unit</a>] section,<br>&nbsp
select "<b>For yEnc: 3,000 lines</b>".<br>
On [GUI options] page, in [<a href="option2.htm#block_allocation">Block allocating method</a>] section,<br>&nbsp
check "<b>Limit Block count up to: 3,000</b>" and set "<b>Block size: 384,000</b>".<br>
On [Client behavior] page, in [Creation options] section,<br>&nbsp
check "<b>Don't search subfolders</b>".<br>
On [Client behavior] page, in [Verification and Repair options] section,<br>&nbsp
select "<b>For 15 days</b>" at "<a href="option3.htm#reuse_result">Re-use verification result</a>".
</p>
<p>&nbsp
There are some different behavior between MultiPar and QuickPar. 
Because MultiPar tries to select efficient block size to create PAR2 files, 
initial block count may differ, even when the setting is same. 
If you want "Recovery File Size: Variable (power of 2 sizing scheme)" in QuickPar, 
select "Sizing scheme: Variable size" in MultiPar. 
When you create additional recovery files against existing recovery set by "Extra", 
QuickPar creates extra files without modifying original files, 
but MultiPar re-creates all files by over-writing original files.
</p>
<p>&nbsp
The biggest difference between MultiPar and QuickPar is the support of multi-languages. 
While QuickPar saves non-ASCII filename by a system specific character encoding, 
MultiPar saves by UTF-8. 
Then, QuickPar cannot read non-ASCII filename correctly which was saved by MultiPar. 
In PAR2 clients, MultiPar and <a href="https://github.com/Parchive/par2cmdline" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/Parchive/par2cmdline">par2cmdline</a> can support Unicode filename.
</p>
<p>&nbsp
Because Peter Clements allowed me to use similer GUI with QuickPar, 
I made MultiPar to treat Japanese filename. 
I made English GUI for foreign users, who got failure in QuickPar. 
When you have trouble using other PAR clients, MultiPar will help. 
If you want to translate MultiPar's text or message, send mail to me. 
MultiPar is used in many countries like;<br>
America, Belgium, China, Denmark, England, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Ukraina, and so on.

<h3>Short-cut keys</h3>

<dl><dt><b>
ALT-key
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
Some buttons have a character with under-line, like "<b><u>O</u></b>pen". 
For those buttons, pushing "ALT-key" and [the under-lined character]-key at one time is same as clicking the button. 
For example, "ALT+O" is same as clicking the "<u>O</u>pen" button. 
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
F1-key
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
You may push "F1-key" to launch this Help. 
There is "<b>Help</b>" button on About window, too.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
F5-key
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
On Verify window, you may push "F5-key" to verify again newly.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Delete-key
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
While you are selecting some source files in file-list on Create window, 
you may push "Delete-key" to remove the files from list. 
This is same as pushing "Remove Files" button.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Page Up</b>, <b>Page Down</b>, <b>Home</b>, and <b>End -keys
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
While you are selecting a slider-bar of "Block Count" or "Redundancy" on Create window or Recreate window, 
you may push these keys. 
If you push "Page Up-key" or "Page Down-key", the slider moves largely. 
It becomes minimum by pushing "Home-key", and becomes maximum by pushing "End-key".
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Escape-key
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
While it is Creating, Verifying, Repairing, or Monitoring, 
you may push "Escape-key" to cancel the process. 
This is same as pushing "Cancel" button. 
Because it requires some interval to interrupt a client actually, 
you need to wait for a while until the result is shown.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Pause-key
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
While it is Creating, Verifying, or Repairing, 
you may push "Pause-key" to pause or resume the process. 
Pushing first time will pause the progress, and second time will resume it again. 
Because it requires some interval to interrupt a client actually, 
pushing the key multiple times quickly may fail to pause.
</dd></dl>
