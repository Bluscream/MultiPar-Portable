<font size=5>Recreate window</font><br><font size=1><br></font>&nbsp
When you push "Extra" button on <a href="verify.htm">Verify window</a>, this window opens. 
While Recreate window is alomst same as Create window, you cannot change source files.
<hr>

<h3>Source files</h3>

<p>&nbsp
The directory and selection of source files are same as the original recovery file. 
Selected files are listed on the file-list, and the total data size and blocks are calculated. 
You cannot change the block allocation, too.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Recovery files</h3>

<dl><dt><b>
Base Filename
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
If you don't want to over-write original files, you may change to a different name.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Comment</b> button
</dt><dd>&nbsp
You can enter newly, or you may change the previous comment.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Redundancy
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
"Redundancy" is a rate of how much damage can be recovered. 
For example, if you set 10% for source files of 500MB, 
you will be able to recover damage or lost upto 50MB. 
<b>Caution</b>, actual possibility of recovery depends on the distribution of damage. 
In general, while dense damage in narrow area may be recovered with small redundancy, 
sparse damage over wide area requires larger redundancy. 
When you set 0%, only an index file to verify will be created.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
First recovery block number
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
If you want to add extra recovery blocks to the original recovery files, 
by setting this starting number, 
you can create recovery files from the previous block. 
If this value is 0, all recovery blocks are recreated from first block.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Number of Recovery blocks
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
You may input the number of recovery blocks directly. 
You can set more blocks than the range of redundancy slider.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Sizing scheme</b> and <b>Number of recovery files
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
"Sizing scheme" is how are the size of recovery files. 
When "<b>All the same size</b>" or "<b>Variable size</b>" is selected, 
you can set the number of recovery files. 
Then, the specified number of recovery files of same size or different size will be created. 
When "<b>Powers of 2 sizing scheme</b>" or "<b>Decimal weights sizing scheme</b>" is selected, 
the number of recovery blocks in each recovery file will be 
"1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128..." or "1, 1, 2, 5, 10, 10, 20, 50...". 
In the later two scheme, size of a recovery file is limited to size of the largest source file.
</dd></dl>

<p>&nbsp
Sample distribution of 500 blocks for each sizing scheme:<br>
<center><table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 width="98%">
<tr bgcolor="E0F0E0"><th>Sizing scheme<th colspan=2>How many blocks in each recovery file
<tr><td>All the same size<td>167, 167, 166 (when 3 files)<td>84, 84, 83, 83, 83, 83 (when 6 files)
<tr><td>Variable size<td>72, 144, 284 (when 3 files)<td>8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 252 (when 6 files)
<tr><td>Powers of 2 sizing scheme<td colspan=2>1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 245 (total 9 files)
<tr><td>Decimal weights sizing scheme<td colspan=2>1, 1, 2, 5, 10, 10, 20, 50, 100, 100, 200, 1 (total 12 files)
</table></center>
</p>

<dl><dt><b>
Efficiency
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
This is a rate of how much data the recovery files can recover. 
For example, when the efficiency is 95% for recovery files of 200MB, 
you will be able to recover upto 190MB.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Number of files that can be fully reconstructed if missing (Min - Max)
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
You may refer these values to know the recoverying capability of recovery files. 
When sizes of source files are largely different, recovering a file may require more redundancy than you thought.
