<hr>

<h3>Donations by PayPal</h3>
<p>&nbsp
While MultiPar is available as freeware, I spent a lot of time and effort to develop. 
Your donation will encourage me to continue my efforts to improve and support MultiPar. 
I made PayPal account and quick link for donation.<br>
<ol>
<li>Click <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=NPNAKA32N4GD6" target="_blank" title="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!">this link</a> to go PayPal's web-page.
<li>On left panel, you can change Quantity, and click Update to multiply the Amount.
<li>On right panel, you select your PayPal account or Credit card.
<li>You may write Message to developer at the bottom of right panel.
</ol>

Other contributions like testing new feature, bug report, advice of refine, etc... would be appreciated also.
