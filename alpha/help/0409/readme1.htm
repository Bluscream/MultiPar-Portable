Restore damaged or lost files with PAR recovery files.<br>
<font size=5>MultiPar</font> &nbsp (set of PAR clients and GUI)
<hr>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>&nbsp
MultiPar was made as an alternative to <a href="http://www.quickpar.org.uk/" target="_blank" title="http://www.quickpar.org.uk/">QuickPar</a>. 
The GUI is similar to QuickPar by getting agreement from Peter Clements. 
While it looks like a multi-lingual version of QuickPar, there are some good features; 
Unicode characters, directory-tree, faster repairing, smaller recovery files, batch scripting, and so on.
</p>

<h3>Feature</h3>
<p>&nbsp
MultiPar supports both PAR 1.0 and PAR 2.0 specifications. 
See the <a href="http://parchive.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" title="http://parchive.sourceforge.net/">Parchive project</a> for details of Parchive. 
MultiPar uses UTF-8 or UTF-16 to treat filenames with non-ASCII characters. 
While MultiPar and <a href="https://github.com/Parchive/par2cmdline" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/Parchive/par2cmdline">par2cmdline</a> can treat sub-directory and UTF-8 filename, 
QuickPar and other PAR2 clients cannot treat them. 
Almost all PAR2 clients don't support UTF-16 filename and comment. 
Be careful to use those special features.
</p>

<h3>System requirement</h3>
<p>&nbsp
MultiPar requires a PC with Windows 7 or later (Windows 8, 10, 11).
</p>

<h3>Usage manual or Help documents</h3>
<p>&nbsp
There are some usage manual or help documents in "help" folder.
English pages exists in "help/0409" folder.
You may open the manual by pushing "F1-key", while using MultiPar.
