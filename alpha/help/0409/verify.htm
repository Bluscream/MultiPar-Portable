<font size=5>Verify window</font><br><font size=1><br></font>&nbsp
When you start MultiPar by selecting a recovery file, this window opens and verification is started. 
You see which files are damaged or lost, and you can repair them if there is enough recovery data. 
If you want to verify again newly, push "<b>F5-key</b>". 
When multiple instances of MultiPar are running, 
it waits finish of another instance's task, and will start next.

<dl><dt><b>
Base directory</b> and <b>Browse</b> button
</dt><dd>&nbsp
This directory is the folder where source files exist. 
If source files exist in a different folder from where recovery files exist, 
all source files are treated as lost. 
Then, you must select the folder by clicking "Browse" button, 
Drag & Drop a folder, or double-click the path box.

</dd></dl>

<p>&nbsp
On the file-list, recovery files are put on upper side, 
and source files are put on lower side. 
Because Size and Status of each file are shown, 
it is easy to know which is incomplete. 
Total size and number of total blocks are shown, too.
</p>

<p>&nbsp
After verification, the result like number of files on each status is shown. 
When source files are damaged or lost, 
you can know whether it is possible to repair or not. 
You may recognize the status easily by their icon color. 
<font color="#009000">[green file]</font> indicates the file is complete. 
<font color="#807800">[yellow file]</font> indicates the file is damaged or misnamed. 
<font color="#C00000">[red file]</font> indicates the file is missing. 
<font color="#807800">[yellow folder]</font> indicates the folder exists. 
<font color="#C00000">[red folder]</font> indicates the folder is missing.

Display of progress

<font color="#807800">[yellow area]</font> indicates recoverable source blocks, 
<font color="#C00000">[red area]</font> indicates how many blocks are lacking.
