<h3>Support</h3>
<p>&nbsp
I use <a href="https://github.com/Yutaka-Sawada/MultiPar/issues" target="_blank" title="issues on GitHub">GitHub issue's page</a> as a web-forum for MultiPar users.
</p>
<p>&nbsp
My name is Yutaka Sawada. 
E-mail address is "tenfon (at mark) outlook.jp". 
Or "multipar (at mark) outlook.jp" for PayPal usage and 
"tenfon (at mark) users.sourceforge.net" for SourceForge users. 
Because they use a same mail-box, don't send duplicate mails. 
Though e-mail address had been "ten_fon (at mark) mail.goo.ne.jp" ago, 
the mail service ended at March 2014, so don't send to there. 
The (at mark) is format to avoid junk mails, and replace it with "@".
</p>
<p>&nbsp
I get many spam mails from oversea. 
If an e-mail is detected as junk mail or suspicious, 
mail server may delete it automatically, and I won't see it.
